<h2>The Pkgsrc Collection</h2>

<p>
%%HOSTNAME%% users can request that additional software be installed on %%HOSTNAME%%'s
head node or compute nodes.

<p>
Most open source software is installed on %%HOSTNAME%% using the
<a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">Pkgsrc</a> package management system,
a fully-automated software installation system with an
extensive collection pre-packaged software.  The Pkgsrc system
was developed by the NetBSD project, but is designed to work on any
POSIX-compatible system.  In addition to being the native package-management
system for NetBSD and SmartOS, Pkgsrc is widely used on Linux
(especially Redhat Enterprise, RHEL, and similar distributions),
Mac OS X, and Solaris.

<p>
Users can browse the Pkgsrc collection by category to see what's available:

<p>
<a href="http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/README.html">Pkgsrc packages by category</a>

<p>
Pkgsrc packages can generally be installed in minutes or hours.
Software not presently in the Pkgsrc collection can also be requested,
but will generally take longer to install.
