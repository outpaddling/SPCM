SPCM has not yet been ported to $(auto-ostype).

Doing so will require adding $(auto-ostype)-specific cases to some scripts
in SPCM and in auto-admin and writing a new cluster-setup script specific
to $(auto-ostype).  Model cluster-setup scripts are available in the
source distribution under FreeBSD/Sys-scripts and RHEL/Sys-scripts.

Please edit scripts in-place in \$LOCALBASE/bin and \$LOCALBASE/sbin and fully
test before sending patches.
