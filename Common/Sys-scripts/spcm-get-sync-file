Usage: $0 host path

$0 is used to save a copy of a system file that was
edited and tested on one of the compute nodes.  It is added to a
collection of system files to be distributed to all compute nodes
using spcm-sync-files.

${host}:$path will be distributed to all compute nodes by
all future spcm-sync-files commands.
