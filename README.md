SPCM
====

The SPCM cluster manager is a free, open source integrated tool set for managing a simple HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster.

It is the only portable cluster management suite we are aware of and is designed to be easily adapted to most POSIX platforms.

SPCM automates the process of configuring a head node, compute nodes, file servers, and visualization nodes. Most common management tasks can be performed using a simple menu interface, while additional tasks are supported by command-line tools.

SPCM automatically installs and integrates the SLURM scheduler and the Ganglia web-based network monitoring suite with the Apache web server.
