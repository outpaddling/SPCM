# SPCM

## Overview

SPCM (Simple, Portable Cluster Manager is a free), open source integrated tool set for
managing a simple HPC (High Performance Computing) cluster.

It is the only portable cluster management suite we are aware of and is
designed to be easily adapted to most POSIX platforms.

SPCM automates the process of configuring a head node, compute nodes, file
servers, and visualization nodes. Most common management tasks can be
performed using a simple menu interface, while additional tasks are supported
by command-line tools.

SPCM automatically installs and integrates the LPJS scheduler and the
Apache web server, ready to accommodate the monitoring system of your
choice (Nagios, Munin, Prometheus, etc.)
